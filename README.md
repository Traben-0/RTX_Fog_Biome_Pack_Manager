[RTX]Fog & Biome & Pack Manager
------
This is the program i've been working on as an extension of my previous fog editor in the MC RTX discord server.

![Image of Program](example.png)

It is able to enable RTX, and manage the biomes and fog settings, of existing resource pack folders, .mcpack files, and standalone biome_client files. 
As well as create RTX ready packs for new creators.

#### Usages include: 
* creating game-ready fog-only packs as .mcpack's from scratch
* copying fog & biome settings from one pack to another pack (per biome)
* removing/adding/changing fog & biome settings in any pack 
* enable RTX in any pack as well as providing RTX fog to that pack
* customize all your pack's biome and fog settings with feedback, 

all from a simple to use GUI
